Rust is pure Binary. Can’t run on ARM processor.

Rust is reliable, not C:
------------------------

Adding max value to 1 in C and Rust : (Check the Assembly code)
a)	C will give -ve number – as it does not have any checks
b)	Rust will throw an error for overflow.

Divide by 0: 
a)	C will give some error – stderr
b)	Rust will properly define the error message.

Rust Ownership:
1.	In C we have to explicity free the memory
2.	In rust we have inbuild ownership.
 
But now if we want ownership back then we use references.
Mutable References:  just add mut variable allow the data to change in reference.
